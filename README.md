The aim of this task is to develop an interactive dashboard to investigate the Belly Button Diversity dataset which documents the microbes take over human belly buttons.

The dashboard comprises of following steps:

•	dropdown to examine data for each individual.
•	bar chart highlighting the top ten microbial species (OTUs or operational taxonomic units).
•	bubble chart featuring all microbial species.
•	gauge represents the frequency of belly button washes weekly for each individual.
